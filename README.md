Diabetes Diagnosis Prediction Model
This project builds a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on health-related features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more. The goal is to classify individuals as diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0).

Dataset
The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, containing the following features:

Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age

Outcome (target): 1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic

Approach
Model: Random Forest Classifier

Data: Loaded from an Excel file (2. Diagnose Diabetes.xlsx)

Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Requirements
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-diagnosis.git
Upload the dataset file and run the script to train and evaluate the model
